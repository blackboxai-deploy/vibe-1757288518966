# Security Policy

## Overview

BaddBeatz takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, incident response procedures, and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## Recent Security Incidents

### YouTube API Key Exposure (Resolved)

**Date:** 5 days ago  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Documentation:** [YOUTUBE_API_KEY_UPDATE.md](../YOUTUBE_API_KEY_UPDATE.md)

**Summary:**
GitHub Secret Scanning detected a Google API key (`[REDACTED-API-KEY]` - **REDACTED**) exposed in our repository across 3 locations.

**Remediation Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Immediately rotated the compromised API key
- ✅ Revoked the leaked key in Google Cloud Console
- ✅ Removed the key from all source files and commit history
- ✅ Implemented automated secret scanning workflows
- ✅ Enhanced security documentation and procedures
- ✅ Added preventive measures to CI/CD pipeline

**Lessons Learned:**
- All API keys must use environment variables
- Automated secret scanning is essential
- Regular security audits prevent incidents
- Documentation is crucial for incident response

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| 1.x.x   | ❌ No              |

## Security Measures

### 1. Secret Management
- **Environment Variables:** All sensitive data stored as environment variables
- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Zero tolerance for hardcoded API keys, tokens, or passwords
- **Automated Scanning:** Daily secret scanning via GitHub Actions
- **Incident Response:** Documented procedures for secret exposure

### 2. API Security
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- **Rate Limiting:** IP-based rate limiting implemented
- **CORS Protection:** Proper CORS configuration for API endpoints
- **Input Validation:** All user inputs validated and sanitized

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Only:** All communications encrypted with TLS
- **Security Headers:** Comprehensive security headers implemented
- **Content Security Policy:** CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
- **Dependency Scanning:** Regular vulnerability scans of dependencies

### 4. Code Security
- **XSS Prevention:** DOMPurify integration for safe HTML rendering
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **Authentication Checks:** Protected routes require valid authentication
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Regular code reviews and security audits

## Automated Security Monitoring

### GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **Secret Scanning** (`.github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml`)
   - Daily automated scans for API keys and secrets
   - Validates YouTube API key incident remediation
   - Generates security reports

2. **CI/CD Security** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Integrated security validation in build process
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Basic secret pattern detection

3. **CodeQL Analysis** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`)
   - Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
   - Automated security issue detection

### Security Alerts
- **GitHub Secret Scanning:** Enabled for automatic secret detection
- **Dependabot:** Automated dependency vulnerability alerts
- **CodeQL:** Static analysis security alerts

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

1. **Email:** security@baddbeatz.com
2. **GitHub Security Advisory:** Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. **Encrypted Communication:** PGP key available on request

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if known)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development:** Within 7 days (critical), 30 days (non-critical)
- **Public Disclosure:** After fix deployment and user notification

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Development Guidelines

1. **Never commit secrets:**
   ```bash
   # ❌ Wrong
   const API_KEY = "[REDACTED-API-KEY]"; // REDACTED - Example only
   
   # ✅ Correct
   const API_KEY = process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY;
   ```

2. **Use environment variables:**
   ```javascript
   // ✅ Correct approach
   const config = {
     openaiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
     jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
     databaseUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL
   };
   ```

3. **Validate all inputs:**
   ```javascript
   // ✅ Input validation
   const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
   ```

### Pre-commit Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] All sensitive data uses environment variables
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Authentication checks in place
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security headers configured

### .gitignore Requirements

Ensure these patterns are in `.gitignore`:
```
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# API keys and secrets
*.key
*.pem
config/secrets.yml
secrets/

# Database
*.db
*.sqlite

# Logs that might contain sensitive data
logs/
*.log
```

## Incident Response Procedure

### 1. Detection
- Automated alerts from GitHub Secret Scanning
- Manual discovery during code review
- External security researcher report

### 2. Assessment
- Determine severity and impact
- Identify affected systems and data
- Document findings in incident report

### 3. Containment
- Immediately rotate compromised credentials
- Revoke access to affected systems
- Block malicious activity if detected

### 4. Remediation
- Remove secrets from codebase and history
- Deploy security fixes
- Update security measures

### 5. Recovery
- Verify systems are secure
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Update documentation and procedures

### 6. Lessons Learned
- Conduct post-incident review
- Update security procedures
- Implement preventive measures
