# Remaining innerHTML Usage for Manual Security Review

The following JavaScript files contain innerHTML assignments that require manual review and fixing to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

## Files and Lines with innerHTML Usage

- assets/js/youtube.js
- assets/js/ui-utils.js
- assets/js/security-utils.js
- assets/js/pwa-init.js
- assets/js/live-stream-manager.js
- assets/js/intro-video.js
- assets/js/enhanced-animations.js
- assets/js/ai-chat-improved.js
- assets/js/admin.js

## Recommendations

1. Use DOMPurify to sanitize any HTML content before assigning to innerHTML:
```js
element.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userContent);
```

2. Prefer using textContent or safe DOM manipulation methods from security-utils.js:
```js
SecurityUtils.setTextContent(element, userContent);
```

3. Avoid using template literals with innerHTML unless sanitized.

4. Review all marked innerHTML usages and refactor accordingly.

## Next Steps

- Assign a developer to review and fix these innerHTML usages.
- Integrate DOMPurify in the build process.
- Add automated security linting for innerHTML usage.
